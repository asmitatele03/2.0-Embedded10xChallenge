🚀 Knight Rider LED Pattern with Direction Control (LPC2129 – ARM7)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements the classic Knight Rider LED running pattern using the LPC2129 (ARM7) microcontroller.

The LEDs move in a scanning pattern (left → right and right → left), similar to the iconic Knight Rider light effect.

A push-button switch is used to dynamically reverse the LED direction during execution.

This project demonstrates real-time control, bit manipulation, and embedded interaction logic.

🎯 Key Features

8-bit LED running pattern

Direction reversal using single push-button

Edge detection logic for switch

Bit shifting operations (<< and >>)

Boundary condition handling

Embedded GPIO control

🧠 Core Logic Explanation
1️⃣ LED Movement

LEDs shift using bitwise operations.

Left shift (<<) for forward direction.

Right shift (>>) for reverse direction.

2️⃣ Direction Control

A direction flag variable controls movement.

On button press, direction value is toggled.

3️⃣ Switch Handling

Edge detection logic prevents multiple toggles.

Basic debouncing applied.
