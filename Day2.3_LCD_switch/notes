Switch-Based Counter on 16×2 LCD | ARM LPC2129     

This project demonstrates how to interface a 16×2 LCD with the ARM7 rhydolabz microcontroller and display a two-digit 
counter, which increments each time a switch is pressed.

🔧 Key Concepts Covered          

GPIO configuration on rhydolabz

LCD interfacing in 8-bit/4-bit mode (as per your driver file)

Debouncing logic using simple while(sw==0)

Displaying numerical values on LCD using ASCII conversion

Modular programming using separate driver files (lcd_driver.c, delay.c, etc.)

▶️ How the Code Works

The LCD is initialized using custom lcd_init() and command functions.

A variable c stores the current count (0–9).

Inside the infinite loop:

The LCD cursor is set to the first line (0x80).

The two digits of the counter are calculated:

Tens digit → (c/10)+48

Units digit → (c%10)+48

LCD is refreshed using command 0x01.

When the switch (P0.14) is pressed:

The counter increments.

Rolls back to 0 after 9.

Debouncing is done with while(sw==0);
