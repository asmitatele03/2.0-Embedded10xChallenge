LED Speed Control Using Switch (3-Mode Blinking) – LPC2148 ARM7
Overview

This project demonstrates how a single push-button switch can be used to control three different LED blinking speeds on the LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller.
Each press changes the LED mode:

Press Count	Mode	Blink Speed
1st press	Mode 1	Slow blink ⏳
2nd press	Mode 2	Medium blink ⚡
3rd press	Mode 3	Fast blink 🚀
4th press	Back to Mode 1	(Mode resets)

The logic uses a simple mode counter and an array holding three different delay values.

Concepts Used
4
1️⃣ Switch Interfacing

Switch connected to P0.14 (configured as input).

It is active LOW, meaning it reads 0 when pressed.

2️⃣ Mode Selection Using a Counter

Variable mode cycles through 0 → 1 → 2 → 0.

Achieved by the expression:

mode = (mode + 1) % 3;

3️⃣ LED Blinking at Different Speeds

LED connected to P0.17.

Delay values stored in the array:

int speed[] = {900000, 500000, 150000};

4️⃣ Software Debouncing

A small delay (300000 cycles) prevents counting the same press multiple times.

Why This Project Is Useful?

Demonstrates User Interface (UI) using only a single switch.

Shows how embedded systems manage modes and state transitions.

A good stepping stone to more advanced systems like:

Multi-mode appliances

Timers

Motor speed control

LED chasers

Menu toggling using a single switch
