🔥 What the Code Does

Blink all LEDs five times

Uses IO1CLR = 0xFF to turn ON all LEDs

Uses IO1SET = 0xFF to turn OFF all LEDs

Repeats this sequence 5 times

Left-to-Right LED Shifting (5 cycles)

Uses (1 << j) bit shifting to activate each LED one by one

Creates a "running light" effect

Repeats the pattern 5 times

📌 Concepts Covered

GPIO configuration using IO1DIR, IO1SET, IO1CLR

Delay generation using nested loops

Bitwise operations for LED control

Loop-based LED blinking and shifting patterns
