📌Project Title: LCD Custom Character Using CGRAM (LPC2129)
📝 Description

This program demonstrates how to create and display custom characters on a 16×2 LCD by using the CGRAM (Character Generator RAM) .
CGRAM allows defining up to 8 custom characters (locations 0–7), each with an 8-byte pixel pattern.

🔧 Key Functions

lcd_init()
Initializes the LCD in 4-bit/8-bit mode and sets display configuration.

lcd_cgram()
Writes custom 5×8 dot patterns into CGRAM addresses.

lcd_cmd()
Sends commands to LCD (example: 0x82 sets cursor to a DDRAM location).

lcd_data()
Sends data bytes to LCD (0–7 will display custom characters stored in CGRAM).

📍 How It Works

The program initializes the LCD.

Loads a custom character pattern into CGRAM location 1.

Moves cursor to position (using 0x82).

Displays the custom character by calling lcd_data(1).
