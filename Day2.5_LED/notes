In today’s task, I implemented an LED blinking sequence on the LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller using GPIO register-level programming.
This program focuses on even-bit LED blinking using a step of +2 inside the loop.

🔍 What This Program Does

Configures Port 0 pins as output using IODIR0

Turns all LEDs OFF initially using IOSET0

Blinks LEDs connected to even-numbered bits (0, 2, 4, 6)

Uses IOCLR0 (active low) to turn LEDs ON

Uses IOSET0 to turn LEDs OFF

Simple loop-based LED pattern with a delay

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

GPIO direction configuration

Even-bit iteration using i = i + 2

Use of IOSET0 & IOCLR0 in active-low systems

Understanding how bit shifting controls individual LED lines

Infinite while loop execution on ARM microcontrollers

🧩 Code Logic Summary

Loop runs through 0 → 2 → 4 → 6

LEDs blink only when i == 0 or i == 2 (based on example condition)

Delay functions used for visible blinking

Active-low logic is essential for LPC2129 LED circuits

📌 Applications

Learning bit-masking and GPIO control

LED animations and patterns

Foundational understanding of register-based embedded programming
