1. Header Files

#include <lpc21xx.h>
#include "header.h"

* lpc21xx.h: Contains register definitions for the LPC2129 microcontroller.
* `header.h`: User-defined header file that includes function prototypes for `lcd_init()`, `lcd_cmd()`, `lcd_string()`, `delay_ms()` etc.

2. Main Function

int main()
{
    int i;
    lcd_init();

* The variable **`i`** is used for the loop.
* `lcd_init()` initializes the 16×2 LCD in 4-bit/8-bit mode (as defined in your driver).
  It sets:
  ✔ LCD function set
  ✔ Display on/off
  ✔ Cursor and entry mode
  ✔ Clear display

3. Infinite Loop
while(1)
{
* Embedded programs usually run forever, so infinite loop (`while(1)`) is used.

4. For Loop for LCD Scrolling

```c
for(i = 0; i < 16; i++)
{
    lcd_cmd(0x80 + i);
    lcd_string("good afternoon");
    delay_ms(200);
    lcd_cmd(0x01);
}

a) `lcd_cmd(0x80 + i)`**

* 0x80 is the base address of Row 1, Column 0 in DDRAM.
* Adding `i` shifts the cursor one position to the right each time.
* This creates a scrolling text effect.

b) `lcd_string("good afternoon")`

* Prints the given message starting from the cursor position.

c) `delay_ms(200)`

* Slows down the scrolling for readability.
* 200 ms = 0.2 seconds.

d) `lcd_cmd(0x01)`

* 0x01 = Clear Display command
* Clears LCD and returns cursor to (0,0) position.
* This is required before placing the string at the next shifted position.

5. Overall Working

✔ The LCD displays “good afternoon”
✔ Text scrolls from left to right across the first row
✔ Each step waits for 200 ms
✔ Screen clears after each shift
✔ Loop repeats endlessly

## **6. Applications**

This logic is useful for:

* Scrolling announcements
* Digital name boards
* Notice displays
* Embedded dashboards

---

## **7. Possible Improvements**

If you want **smooth scrolling**, instead of clearing the LCD each time, you can use the command:

➡ **Display Shift Right** → `0x1C`
➡ **Display Shift Left** → `0x18`

If you want, I can also prepare:

✅ GitHub-ready README notes
✅ Block diagram
✅ Flowchart
✅ Improved scrolling code
✅ Explanation for viva/practical exam
