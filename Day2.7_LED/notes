🔹 Title: Dual Wave Mirror LED Pattern – LPC2148 | Day 2.7 Embedded C Challenge
📌 Overview
This program creates a unique dual-wave LED blinking pattern on the LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller using 8 LEDs connected to Port 0 pins P0.16 to P0.23. 
The pattern includes center-outward blinking, outward-inward wave, alternating bit patterns, and full-blink effects.
It is an advanced pattern demonstrating bitwise operations, GPIO control, looping logic, and timing.

🔹 Pattern Description

The program performs the following four sequences:

1️⃣ Center → Outward Wave

Starts from the middle two LEDs (P0.19 and P0.20)

Expands outward symmetrically

Creates a “pulse expanding” visual effect

2️⃣ Outward → Center Wave

Reverse of the above

Creates a “pulse contracting” effect

3️⃣ Alternate LED Blinking

Displays: 10101010

Then: 01010101

Repeats for four cycles

Demonstrates binary masking and bit-shifting

4️⃣ Full Blink Pattern

All LEDs ON

All LEDs OFF

Repeats 3 times

Simple but visually impactful

🔹 Key Learning Points

Using bitwise shifts and masks to control LEDs

Implementing multi-phase LED wave animations

Writing readable and modular embedded C code

Controlling delay without timers (simple for beginners)

Practical understanding of ARM7 GPIO registers
