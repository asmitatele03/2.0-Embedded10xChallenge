--->Binary Counter with Short & Long Press Detection (LPC2129)

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a 4-bit binary counter implemented using LPC2129 (ARM7). The system 
uses a single push-button switch to perform two different operations:
       
Short Press → Increment counter (0–15)

Long Press → Reset counter to 0

The counter value is displayed on 4 LEDs in binary format.

🛠 Hardware Used
