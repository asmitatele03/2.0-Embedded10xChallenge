# 2.0-Embedded10xChallenge
✨ Successfully Completed My 10-Day Embedded Systems Challenge! ✨
This marks the completion of my 10-day hands-on challenge in Embedded C programming, where I worked on building and testing forward drivers for:
🔹 16×2 LCD Display
🔹 LED Control
🔹 Switch Input Handling
During this challenge, I learned to write and test drivers for LCD commands, DDRAM addressing, cursor control, 4/8-bit mode initialization, GPIO 
configuration, and switch-based LED control. This helped me understand how low-level hardware interacts with software in real time.
📌 Key Milestones Completed
✔ LCD initialization
✔ Writing characters on first and second lines using DDRAM addresses
✔ LED toggle logic
✔ Switch interfacing
✔ Forward driver structure using modular C programming
✔ Debugging in Keil + testing on hardware
🚀 What’s Next? 10 More Days!
I am excited to announce that I am extending this challenge for another 10 days, where I will implement:
🔸 Interrupt-based switch handling (EINT0 / GPIO interrupts)
🔸 More advanced LCD patterns and custom characters (CGRAM)
🔸 Multi-task LED + Switch + LCD logic💡

“Small steps daily create massive transformations.”
“Consistency beats talent — 10 days of hard work can change your confidence.”
